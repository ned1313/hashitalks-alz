Example repository for my HashiTalks 2025 Azure Landing Zones presentation

## Overview

This repository is meant to work with HCP Terraform Stacks and the newly released Azure Verified Modules for Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) to deploy a basic landing zone setup. If you want to follow along, you will need at least two Azure subscriptions and owner level permissions on those subscriptions.
